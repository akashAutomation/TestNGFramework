 1. It is an open source automated TestNG framework. In TestNG, NG stands for "Next Generation".
 2. TestNG is a testing framework inspired from JUnit and NUnit.
 3. It is for the Java programming language.
 4. It covers a broader range of test categories: unit, functional, end-to-end, integration, etc.
 
 4. Advantages --> 1. TestNG provides HTML reports by default for test execution. You can even add your own custom reports when required.
				   2. Annotations made testers life easy
				   3. Test cases can be Grouped & Prioritized more easily
                   4. Parallel testing is possible
                   5. Generates Logs
                   6. Data Parameterization is possible --> This feature allows you to pass the arguments as parameters and this achieved by using @Parameters annotation
                   7. To achieve the data-driven testing, DataProvider feature is used.
                   8. 
                   
                   
  TestNG Annotations --> 1. TestNG annotations are the code that is written inside your source test code logic to control the flow of the execution of tests. 
  						 2.	It is essential to annotate your methods in TestNG to run the tests. 
  						 3.	TestNG will ignore the method which does not contain an annotation since it won't know when to execute this method.
						 4.	A TestNG annotation starts from the symbol "@".   
						 
  Types of TestNG Annotations -->
  		1. @BeforeSuite - The @BeforeSuite method in TestNG runs before the execution of all other test methods in the suite.
		2. @AfterSuite - The @AfterSuite method in TestNG runs after the execution of all other test methods in the suite.
		3. @BeforeTest - The @BeforeTest method in TestNG runs before the execution of all the test methods of available classes belonging to that folder.
		4. @AfterTest - The @AfterTest method in TestNG executes after the execution of all the test methods of available classes belonging to that folder.
		5. @BeforeClass - The @BeforeClass method in TestNG will run before the first method of the current class is invoked.
		6. @AfterClass - The @AfterClass method in TestNG will execute after the execution of all the test methods of the current class.
		7. @BeforeMethod - The @BeforeMethod method in TestNG will execute before each test method.
		8. @AfterMethod - The @AfterMethod method in TestNG will run after each test method is executed.
		9. @BeforeGroups - The @BeforeGroups annotated method run only once for a group before the execution of all test cases belonging to that group.
		10. @AfterGroups - The @AfterGroups annotated method run only once for a group after the execution of all test cases belonging to that group.
